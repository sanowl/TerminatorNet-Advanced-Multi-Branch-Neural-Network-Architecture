# TerminatorNet: Advanced Multi-Branch Neural Network Architecture

## Overview

TerminatorNet is a novel neural network architecture designed to enhance feature extraction and reduce model parameters by integrating a slow-fast network mechanism. It uses multiple branches to process data, enabling detailed feature extraction at each layer. The key innovation, the HyperZ路Z路W operator, allows context-dependent fast weights, eliminating the need for residual learning and improving training efficiency.

## Features

- **Multi-Branch Structure**: Enhances feature extraction by using multiple branches to process data.
- **HyperZ路Z路W Operator**: Connects hyper-kernels and hidden activations through elementwise multiplication, enabling context-dependent fast weights.
- **Slow-Fast Network**: Combines a slow network for generating large patterns (hyper-kernels) and a fast network for dynamic data processing.
- **Efficient Training**: Faster training convergence with fewer parameters compared to traditional architectures.

## Architecture

The architecture consists of two main components:

1. **Slow Network**:
   - Generates large hyper-kernels using coordinate-based implicit MLPs.
   
2. **Fast Network**:
   - Uses the hyper-kernels for dynamic, context-dependent data processing.

## Use Cases

- Image Classification
- Object Detection
- Medical Imaging Analysis
- Autonomous Vehicles
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
